# Penguino-STM32WL-MAMWLExx
This repo contains all the necessary design and fabrication files for the [Move Solution's MAMWLExx](https://www.hackster.io/move-solutions/design-a-lora-communication-board-based-on-mamwlexx-cbf25c) based Penguino STM32WL breakout board.

MAMWLExx is a very tiny low power radio module, which can be easily integrated into any PCB to enable it for wireless communication. It measures only 15x16mm and features 52 pins out of which 38 are multi-purpose GPIOs.
